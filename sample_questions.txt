## Tips for Asking Questions:

1. **Be Specific**: More specific questions often yield better, more focused answers.
2. **Use Medical Terminology**: The system is designed for medical professionals and understands clinical language.
3. **Ask Follow-up Questions**: Build on previous answers to get deeper insights.
4. **Combine Topics**: Ask questions that span multiple aspects (dosing + monitoring, mechanism + clinical use).
5. **Request Comparisons**: Ask how azithromycin compares to other treatments.

## Question Categories:

### Basic Information:
- What is azithromycin?
- What type of antibiotic is azithromycin?
- How does azithromycin work?

### Clinical Usage:
- What infections is azithromycin used for?
- How is azithromycin prescribed?
- What is the typical treatment course?

### Safety and Monitoring:

## Testing the System:

To test the document selection and citation system:
1. Start with basic questions from Document 1
2. Try clinical questions from Document 2
3. Ask laboratory questions from Document 3
4. Test multi-document queries
5. Verify that responses include proper citations and references

Remember: The system will automatically select the most relevant document(s) based on your question content and provide citations in the response.
